[[File:IPod family.png|250px|thumb|The iPod line as of September 2012; from left to right: [[iPod Shuffle]], [[iPod Nano]], [[iPod Classic]], [[iPod Touch]].]]
The '''iPod''' is a line of [[portable media player]]s designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] The first line was released on November 10, 2001, its most recent redesigns announced on September 12, 2012. There are four current versions of the iPod: the ultra-compact [[iPod Shuffle]], the compact [[iPod Nano]], the touchscreen [[iPod Touch]], and the hard drive-based [[iPod Classic]]. 

Like other digital music players, iPods can serve as external [[USB mass storage device class|data storage devices]]. Storage capacity varies by model, ranging from 2&amp;nbsp;GB for the iPod Shuffle to 160&amp;nbsp;GB for the iPod Classic. The devices are controlled by the [[Samsung]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and the [[Apple A5]] [[central processing unit|CPU]]s.

Apple's [[iTunes]] software (and other open source software) can be used to transfer music, photos, videos, [[iPod game|games]], contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and calendars, to the devices supporting these features from computers using certain versions of Apple [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ | title=iTunes system requirements. Apple iTunes software runs on Mac OS X 10.3.9 or OS X 10.4.9 or later and on Microsoft Windows XP (Service Pack 2) or Vista | author=Apple Inc. | accessdate=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/07/08/10-alternatives-to-itunes-for-managing-your-ipod/ | title=10 Alternatives to iTunes for managing your iPod |first=Ross |last=McKillop|publisher=Simple Help |date=July 8, 2007| accessdate=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to iOS 5, the iPod branding was used for the media player included with the [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]], a combination of the Music and Videos apps on the iPod Touch. As of iOS 5, separate apps named &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Video&quot; are standardized across all iOS-powered products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgr.com/nggallery/page-320/album-all/gallery-186/image/2403/|title=APPLE IOS 5 IPHONE / IPAD HANDS-ON (screenshot of iPhone home screen with iOS 5 preview)|work=[[Boy Genius Report]]|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media-player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally treated as separate products. In the last few years, iPhone and iPad sales have overtaken those of the iPod.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Apple Inc. products}}
[[File:Various iPods.jpg|thumb|Various iPod models, all of which have been discontinued or updated.]]
The iPod line came from Apple's &quot;digital hub&quot; category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players &quot;big and clunky or small and useless&quot; with user interfaces that were &quot;unbelievably awful,&quot;&lt;ref name=straight&gt;Kahney, Leander.[http://www.wired.com/news/columns/cultofmac/0,71956-0.html Straight Dope on the iPod's Birth], ''[[Wired News]]'', October 17, 2006. Retrieved on October 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO [[Steve Jobs]], Apple's hardware engineering chief [[Jon Rubinstein]] assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers [[Tony Fadell]] and [[Michael Dhuey]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.designnews.com/article/CA6478178.html 2007 Engineer of the Year Finalist Michael Dhuey’s Hardware Knowledge Helps Breathe Life Into iPod, TelePresence]&quot;, ''Design News'', September 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and design engineer [[Jonathan Ive]].&lt;ref name=straight /&gt;  Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Jobs by Walter Issac page 865&lt;/ref&gt;  The product was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive that put &quot;1,000 songs in your pocket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/origin-of-the-ipod.html |title=A History of the iPod: 2000 to 2004 |publisher=Lowendmac.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple did not develop the iPod software entirely in-house, instead using [[PortalPlayer]]'s reference platform based on two [[ARM architecture|ARM]] cores. The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with [[Bluetooth]] headphones.&lt;ref name=straight /&gt; Apple contracted another company, [[Pixo]], to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs.&lt;ref name=straight /&gt; As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the [[iPod Mini]], the [[Chicago (typeface)|Chicago]] font was replaced with [[Espy Sans]]. Later iPods switched fonts again to [[Podium Sans]]—a font similar to Apple's corporate font, [[Myriad (typeface)|Myriad]]. iPods with color displays then adopted some [[Mac OS X]] themes like Aqua progress bars, and [[Brushed Metal (interface)|brushed metal]] meant to evoke a [[combination lock]]. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again with the introduction of the sixth-generation [[iPod Classic]] and third-generation [[iPod Nano]] by changing the font to [[Helvetica]] and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item).

In September 2007, during a lawsuit with [[patent holding company]] Burst.com, Apple drew attention to a patent for a similar device that was developed in 1979. [[Kane Kramer]] applied for a UK patent for his design of a &quot;plastic music box&quot; in 1981, which he called the IXI.&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;Boffey, Daniel [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1053152/Apple-admit-Briton-DID-invent-iPod-hes-getting-money.html Apple admit Briton DID invent iPod, but he's still not getting any money] ''[[Daily Mail]]'', September 8, 2008. Retrieved on September 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to secure funding to renew the US$ 120,000 worldwide patent, so it lapsed and Kramer never profited from his idea.&lt;ref name=DailyMail /&gt;

The name ''iPod'' was proposed by Vinnie Chieco, a freelance copywriter, who (with others) was called by Apple to figure out how to introduce the new player to the public. After Chieco saw a prototype, he thought of the movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and the phrase &quot;Open the pod bay door, [[HAL 9000|Hal]]!&quot;, which refers to the white [[EVA Pod]]s of the [[Discovery One]] spaceship. Chieco saw an analogy to the relationship between the spaceship and the smaller independent pods in the relationship between a personal computer and the music player.&lt;ref name=straight /&gt; Apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use. Joseph N. Grasso of [[New Jersey]] had originally listed an &quot;iPod&quot; trademark with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) in July 2000 for [[Internet kiosk]]s. The first iPod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in New Jersey in March 1998, and commercial use began in January 2000, but had apparently been discontinued by 2001. The trademark was registered by the USPTO in November 2003, and Grasso assigned it to Apple Computer, Inc. in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Serial No. 78018061, Registration No. 2781793, records of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. InPub, LLC, filed an &quot;IPOD&quot; trademark on June 1, 1999, for &quot;computer software and hardware.&quot; The trademark was abandoned May 18, 2000, without commercial use.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded use in commerce of an &quot;iPod&quot; trademark was in 1991 by Chrysalis Corp. of Sturgis, Michigan, styled &quot;iPOD&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ipod by Chrysalis Incorporated|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/ipod-74132201.html|publisher=Trademarkia|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response, as shown in audio tests.&lt;ref name=playertest&gt;Machrone, Bill. [http://home.comcast.net./~machrone/playertest/playertest.htm iPod audio measurements], ''[[PC Magazine]]'', 2005. Retrieved on February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heijligers, Marc. [http://members.chello.nl/~m.heijligers/ipod/Performance/measurements.html iPod audio measurements]. Retrieved on February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the undersized DC-blocking [[capacitor]]s and the typical low-[[electrical impedance|impedance]] of most consumer headphones form a [[high-pass filter]], which attenuates the low-frequency bass outputSupplier. Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods.&lt;ref&gt;Heijligers, Marc. [http://homepage.mac.com/marc.heijligers/audio/ipod/engineering/engineering.html iPod circuit design engineering], May 2006. Retrieved on February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external [[headphone amplifier]]. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a [[Bridge tied load|dual-transistor outputSupplier stage]],&lt;ref name=playertest /&gt; rather than a single capacitor-coupled outputSupplier, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.

For all iPods released in 2006 and earlier, some [[Equalization|equalizer (EQ)]] sound settings would distort the bass sound far too easily, even on undemanding songs.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Austin. {{cite web|url=http://www.dapreview.net/news.php?extend.642|title=Tweaking the iPod equalizer|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6At6m5ZoY|archivedate=30 September 2012|deadurl=no}}, ''DAP review'', 8 November 2004.

Retrieved on September 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This would happen for EQ settings like R&amp;B, Rock, Acoustic, and Bass Booster, because the equalizer amplified the digital audio level beyond the software's limit, causing distortion ([[clipping (audio)|clipping]]) on bass instruments.

From the fifth-generation iPod on, Apple introduced a user-configurable volume limit in response to concerns about hearing loss.&lt;ref name=volumelimit&gt;Cohen, Peter. [http://www.macworld.com/article/50101/2006/03/ipodupdate.html iPod update limits iPod volume setting], Macworld, 2006. Retrieved on November 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Users report that in the sixth-generation iPod, the maximum volume outputSupplier level is limited to 100 dB in EU markets. Apple previously had to remove iPods from shelves in France for exceeding this legal limit.&lt;ref name=ipodsfrance&gt;Fried, Ian. [http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-960211.html Apple pulls iPod in France]. Retrieved on November 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connectivity===
{{See also|Dock connector#Apple}}
[[File:4 iPod Chargers.JPG|thumb|right|Four iPod wall chargers for [[NEMA connector|North America]], all made by Apple. These have FireWire (left) and USB (right three) connectors, which allow iPods to charge without a computer. The units have been [[Miniaturization|miniaturized]] over time.]]

Originally, a [[FireWire]] connection to the host computer was used to update songs or recharge the [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The battery could also be charged with a power adapter that was included with the first four generations.

The third generation began including a 30-pin [[dock connector]], allowing for FireWire or [[USB]] connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single [[Phone connector (audio)|3.5&amp;nbsp;mm minijack phone connector]] which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock.

The dock connector also allowed the iPod to connect to accessories, which often supplement the iPod's music, video, and photo playback. Apple sells a few accessories, such as the now-discontinued [[iPod Hi-Fi]], but most are manufactured by third parties such as [[Belkin]] and [[Griffin Technology|Griffin]]. Some peripherals use their own interface, while others use the iPod's own screen. Because the dock connector is a proprietary interface, the implementation of the interface requires paying royalties to Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Joel |last= Johnson |title= How the &quot;Apple Tax&quot; Boosts Prices on iPod &amp; iPhone Accessories|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4272628.html?page=1|publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date= July 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple introduced a new 8-pin dock connector, named [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning]], on September 12, 2012 with their announcement of the [[iPhone 5]], the fifth generation [[iPod Touch]], and the seventh generation [[iPod Nano]], which all feature it. The new connector replaces the older 30-pin dock connector used by older iPods, iPhones, and iPads. Apple Lightning cables have pins on both sides of the plug so it can be inserted with either side facing up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/iphone/features Apple iPhone 5 features; Apple.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessories===
[[File:Made for iPod.svg|thumb|right|150px|The &quot;Made for iPod&quot; logo found on most classic iPod accessories]]
Many accessories have been made for the iPod line. A large number are made by third party companies, although many, such as the [[iPod Hi-Fi]], are made by Apple. Some accessories add extra features that other music players have, such as sound recorders, FM radio tuners, wired remote controls, and audio/visual cables for TV connections. Other accessories offer unique features like the [[Nike+iPod]] pedometer and the iPod Camera Connector. Other notable accessories include external speakers, wireless remote controls, protective case, screen films, and wireless earphones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er88.aspx In-The-Ear Bluetooth Earphones].

The iPod line can play several [[audio file format]]s including MP3, [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]/[[MPEG-4 Part 14|M4A]], [[FairPlay|Protected AAC]], [[AIFF]], [[WAV]], [[Audible.com|Audible]] [[audiobook]], and [[Apple Lossless]]. The iPod photo introduced the ability to display [[JPEG]], [[Windows bitmap|BMP]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[TIFF]], and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image file formats. Fifth and sixth generation iPod Classics, as well as third generation iPod Nanos, can additionally play [[MPEG-4]] ([[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]]) and [[QuickTime]] [[container format|video formats]], with restrictions on video dimensions, encoding techniques and data-rates.&lt;ref&gt;The restrictions vary from generation to generation; for the earliest video iPods, video is required to be [[Hi10P|Baseline Profile]] (BP), up to [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC#Levels|Level 1.3]], meaning most significantly no [[B-frame]]s (BP), a maximum bitrate of 768 kb/s (BP Level 1.3), and a maximum framerate of 30 frame/s at 320×240 resolution. Newer iPods support BP up to level 3.0 (10,000 kb/s), for a maximum framerate of 30 frame/s at 640×480 resolution. Current specifications can be seen at [http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/specs.html iPod classic Technical Specs], and practical implementations can be seen in the libx264-ipod320.ffpreset and libx264-ipod640.ffpreset preset files for [[FFmpeg]], as discussed in [http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2006-June/003218.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[Ffmpeg-user]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Successful ipod h264 encoding], by Daniel Rogers, Jun 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, iPod software only worked with [[Mac OS]]; iPod software for [[Microsoft Windows]] was launched with the second generation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ |title=iTunes Downloads |publisher=Apple.com |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other media players, Apple does not support [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] audio format—but a converter for WMA files without [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) is provided with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of iTunes. [[MIDI]] files also cannot be played, but can be converted to audio files using the &quot;Advanced&quot; menu in iTunes. Alternative open-source audio formats, such as [[Ogg Vorbis]] and [[FLAC]], are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod (e.g., [[Rockbox]]).

During installation, an iPod is associated with one host computer. Each time an iPod connects to its host computer, iTunes can synchronize entire music libraries or music playlists either automatically or manually. Song ratings can be set on an iPod and synchronized later to the iTunes library, and vice versa. A user can access, play, and add music on a second computer if an iPod is set to manual and not automatic sync, but anything added or edited will be reversed upon connecting and syncing with the main computer and its library. If a user wishes to automatically sync music with another computer, an iPod's library will be entirely wiped and replaced with the other computer's library.

===Interface===
[[File:IPod wheel.svg|thumb|The signature [[iPod click wheel]].]]
iPods with color displays use [[spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliased]] graphics and text, with sliding animations. All iPods (except the [[iPod Shuffle|3rd-generation iPod Shuffle]], the [[iPod Nano|6th generation iPod Nano]], and [[iPod Touch]]) have five buttons and the later generations have the buttons integrated into the [[iPod click wheel|click wheel]] – an innovation that gives an uncluttered, minimalist [[User interface|interface]]. The buttons perform basic functions such as menu, play, pause, next track, and previous track. Other operations, such as scrolling through menu items and controlling the volume, are performed by using the click wheel in a rotational manner. The 3rd-generation [[iPod Shuffle]] does not have any controls on the actual player; instead it has a small control on the earphone cable, with volume-up and -down buttons and a single button for play and pause, next track, etc. The [[iPod Touch]] has no click-wheel; instead it uses a 3.5&quot; touch screen along with a home button, sleep/wake button and (on the second and third generations of the iPod Touch) volume-up and -down buttons. The user interface for the iPod Touch is identical to that of the [[iPhone]]. Differences include a lack of a phone application. Both devices use [[iOS]].

===iTunes Store===
{{Main|iTunes|iTunes Store}}
The iTunes Store (introduced April 29, 2003) is an online media store run by Apple and accessed through iTunes. The store became the market leader soon after its launch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/aug/10itms.html iTunes Music Store Catalog Tops One Million Songs], ''[[Apple Inc.]]'', August 10, 2004. Retrieved on December 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and Apple announced the sale of videos through the store on October 12, 2005. Full-length movies became available on September 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Joynt, Jeremy. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5339470.stm Apple targets TV and film market], ''[[BBC News]]'', September 12, 2006. Retrieved on September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the store was introduced, purchased audio files used the AAC format with added encryption, based on the [[FairPlay]] DRM system. Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files. Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD, then re-importing would create music files without the DRM. The DRM could also be removed using third-party software. However, in a deal with Apple, [[EMI]] began selling DRM-free, higher-quality songs on the iTunes Stores, in a category called &quot;iTunes Plus.&quot; While individual songs were made available at a cost of US$1.29, 30¢ more than the cost of a regular DRM song, entire albums were available for the same price, US$9.99, as DRM encoded albums. On 17&amp;nbsp;October 2007, Apple lowered the cost of individual iTunes Plus songs to US$0.99 per song, the same as DRM encoded tracks. On January 6, 2009, Apple announced that DRM has been removed from 80% of the music catalog, and that it would be removed from all music by April 2009.

iPods cannot play music files from competing music stores that use rival-DRM technologies like [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Media DRM|protected WMA]] or [[RealNetworks]]' [[Helix (project)|Helix]] DRM. Example stores include [[Napster]] and [[MSN Music]]. RealNetworks claims that Apple is creating problems for itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanellos|first=Michael|title=Real's Glaser exhorts Apple to open iPod|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1025_3-5177914.html|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=December 20, 2011|date=March 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using FairPlay to lock users into using the iTunes Store. Steve Jobs stated that Apple makes little profit from song sales, although Apple uses the store to promote iPod sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hansell|first=Saul|title=The iTunes Store: Profit Machine|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/steve-jobs-tries-to-downplay-the-itunes-stores-profit/|publisher=August 11, 2008|accessdate=December 20, 2011|date=August 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, iPods can also play music files from online stores that do not use DRM, such as [[eMusic]] or [[Amie Street]].

[[Universal Music Group]] decided not to renew their contract with the iTunes Store on July 3, 2007. Universal will now supply iTunes in an 'at will' capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Jonny. [http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=18459 Universal confirms iTunes contract change], ''[[Macworld UK]]'', July 4, 2007. Retrieved on July 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple debuted the [[iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store]] on September 5, 2007, in its Media Event entitled &quot;The Beat Goes On...&quot;  This service allows users to access the Music Store from either an iPhone or an iPod Touch and download songs directly to the device that can be synced to the user's iTunes Library over a [[WiFi]] connection, or, in the case of an iPhone, the [[telephone network]].

===Games===
{{Main|iPod game|App Store (iOS)}}
Video games are playable on various versions of iPods. The original iPod had the game ''[[Breakout (arcade game)|Brick]]'' (originally invented by Apple's co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]]) included as an [[easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]] hidden feature; later [[firmware]] versions added it as a menu option. Later revisions of the iPod added three more games: ''[[Parachute (iPod Game)|Parachute]]'', ''[[Solitaire]]'', and ''Music Quiz''.

In September 2006, the [[iTunes Store]] began to offer additional games for purchase with the launch of [[iTunes version history|iTunes 7]], compatible with the [[iPod (5G)|fifth generation iPod]] with iPod software 1.2 or later. Those games were: ''[[Bejeweled]]'', ''Cubis 2'', ''[[Mahjong solitaire|Mahjong]]'', ''[[Mini Golf|Mini]] Golf'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[Texas Hold 'Em]]'', ''[[Vortex (iPod game)|Vortex]]'', ''[[Asphalt 4: Elite Racing]]'' and ''[[Zuma (computer game)|Zuma]]''. Additional games have since been added. These games work on the 6th and 5th generation iPod Classic and the 5th and 4th generation iPod Nano.

With third parties like [[Namco]], [[Square Enix]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Sega]], and [[Hudson Soft]] all making games for the iPod, Apple's MP3 player has taken steps towards entering the video game handheld console market. Even video game magazines like [[GamePro]] and [[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]] have reviewed and rated most of their games as of late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/81588/ipod-games-review-roundup/ |title=iPod Games Review Roundup |publisher=Gamepro.com |date=2006-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110607151141/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/81588/ipod-games-review-roundup/|archivedate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The games are in the form of [[.ipg]] files, which are actually [[.zip]] archives in disguise{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. When unzipped, they reveal executable files along with common audio and image files, leading to the possibility of [[third-party developer|third party games]]. Apple has not publicly released a [[software development kit]] (SDK) for iPod-specific development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bensinclair.com/article/whats-inside-an-ipod-game &quot;What's Inside an iPod Game?&quot;] bensinclair.com, September 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Apps produced with the [[iPhone SDK]] are compatible only with the [[iOS]] on the iPod Touch and iPhone, which cannot run clickwheel-based games.

===File storage and transfer===
All iPods except for the iPod Touch can function in &quot;disk mode&quot; as [[USB mass storage device class|mass storage devices]] to store data files&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306414 |title=iPod touch: Appears in iTunes but not in Finder or Windows Desktop |publisher=Docs.info.apple.com |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this may not be the default behavior, and in the case of the iPod Touch, requires special software.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  If an iPod is formatted on a Mac OS X computer, it uses the [[HFS Plus|HFS+]] file system format, which allows it to serve as a [[boot disk]] for a Mac computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;mdash;Gina Trapani |url=http://lifehacker.com/software/how-to/boot-up-your-mac-from-your-ipod-260157.php |title=How To: Boot up your Mac from your iPod |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date=2007-05-14 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is formatted on Windows, the [[FAT32]] format is used. With the release of the Windows-compatible iPod, the default file system used on the iPod line switched from HFS+ to FAT32, although it can be reformatted to either file system (excluding the iPod Shuffle which is strictly FAT32). Generally, if a new iPod (excluding the iPod Shuffle) is initially plugged into a computer running Windows, it will be formatted with FAT32, and if initially plugged into a Mac running Mac OS X it will be formatted with HFS+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipod.about.com/od/restoreandreformatipod/a/ipod_format_a.htm |title=Restore iPod – Format iPod – Reformat iPod – iPod Restore Software |publisher=Ipod.about.com |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other MP3 players, simply copying audio or video files to the drive with a typical [[file management application]] will not allow an iPod to properly access them. The user must use software that has been specifically designed to transfer media files to iPods, so that the files are playable and viewable. Usually ''iTunes'' is used to transfer media to an iPod, though [[comparison of iPod managers|several alternative third-party applications]] are available on a number of different platforms.

''iTunes'' 7 and above can transfer purchased media of the iTunes Store from an iPod to a computer, provided that computer containing the DRM protected media is authorized to play it.

Media files are stored on an iPod in a hidden folder, along with a proprietary database file. The hidden content can be accessed on the host operating system by enabling [[hidden files]] to be shown. The media files can then be recovered manually by copying the files or folders off the iPod. Many third-party applications also allow easy copying of media files off of an iPod.

On August 24, 2006, Apple and Creative announced a broad settlement to end their legal disputes. Apple will pay Creative US$100&amp;nbsp;million for a paid-up license, to use Creative's awarded patent in all Apple products. As part of the agreement, Apple will recoup part of its payment, if Creative is successful in licensing the patent. Creative then announced its intention to produce iPod accessories by joining the ''Made for iPod'' program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/aug/23settlement.html Apple &amp; Creative Announce Broad Settlement...], , ''[[Apple Inc.]]''.

===Battery problems===
The advertised battery life on most models is different from the real-world achievable life. For example, the fifth generation 30&amp;nbsp;GB iPod is advertised as having up to 14 hours of music playback. An MP3.com report stated that this was virtually unachievable under real-life usage conditions, with a writer for MP3.com getting on average less than 8 hours from an iPod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp3.com/features/stories/3646.html MP3 Insider: The truth about your battery life], ''mp3.com'', March 13, 2006. Retrieved on July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, class action lawsuits were brought against Apple complaining that the battery charges lasted for shorter lengths of time than stated and that the battery degraded over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3477497.stm Apple investigates iPod batteries], ''[[BBC News]]'', February 10, 2004. Retrieved on March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuits were settled by offering individuals either US$50 store credit or a free battery replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, Jeremy.

Retrieved on August 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

iPod batteries are not designed to be removed or replaced by the user, although some users have been able to open the case themselves, usually following instructions from third-party vendors of iPod replacement batteries. Compounding the problem, Apple initially would not replace worn-out batteries. The official policy was that the customer should buy a refurbished replacement iPod, at a cost almost equivalent to a brand new one. All lithium-ion batteries lose capacity during their lifetime even when not in use&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/6002/li_ion.html The Curse of Lithium Ion Batteries], ''[[MP3 Newswire]]'', January 6, 2006. Retrieved on November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (guidelines are available for [[lithium-ion battery#Guidelines for prolonging lithium-ion battery life|prolonging life-span]]) and this situation led to a market for third-party battery replacement kits.

The first generation iPod Nano may overheat and pose a health and safety risk. Affected iPod Nanos were sold between September 2005 and December 2006. This is due to a flawed battery used by Apple from a single battery manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/11/12/apple_opens_up_replacement_program_for_first_gen_ipod_nano.html |title=Apple opens up replacement program for first-gen iPod nano |publisher=Apple Insider |date=November 12, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple recommended that owners of affected iPod Nanos stop using them. Under an Apple product replacement program, affected Nanos were replaced with current generation Nanos free of charge.

===Reliability and durability===
iPods have been criticized for alleged short life-span and fragile hard drives. A 2005 survey conducted on the MacInTouch website found that the iPod line had an average failure rate of 13.7% (although they note that comments from respondents indicate that &quot;the true iPod failure rate may be lower than it appears&quot;). It concluded that some models were more durable than others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macintouch.com/reliability/ipodfailures.html iPod Reliability Survey], ''MacInTouch'', November 28, 2005. Retrieved on October 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, failure rates for iPods employing hard drives was usually above 20% while those with flash memory had a failure rate below 10%. In late 2005, many users complained that the surface of the first generation iPod Nano can become scratched easily, rendering the screen unusable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/09/27/nanoscreen/index.php Apple responds to iPod nano screen concerns], ''[[Macworld]]'', September 27, 2005.

Retrieved on February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Apple initially considered the issue a minor defect, but later began shipping these iPods with protective sleeves.{{citation}}

===Labor disputes===
On June 11, 2006, the British tabloid ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' reported that iPods are mainly manufactured by workers who earn no more than US$50 per month and work 15-hour shifts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=14915 Inside Apple's iPod factories], ''[[Macworld UK]]'', June 12, 2006. Retrieved on March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Apple investigated the case with independent auditors and found that, while some of the plant's labour practices met Apple's Code of Conduct, others did not: employees worked over 60 hours a week for 35% of the time, and worked more than six consecutive days for 25% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Millard, Elizabeth. [http://www.chinesetao.com/Newsfactor%20Sept%202006.pdf Is It Ethical To Own an iPod?]. Retrieved on March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foxconn]], Apple's manufacturer, initially denied the abuses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macnn.com/articles/06/06/19/ipod.sweatshop.claims/ Foxconn denies iPod 'sweatshop' claims], ''MacNN'', June 19, 2006. Retrieved on February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but when an auditing team from Apple found that workers had been working longer hours than were allowed under Chinese law, they promised to prevent workers working more hours than the code allowed. Apple hired a workplace standards auditing company, Verité, and joined the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct Implementation Group to oversee the measures. On December 31, 2006, workers at the Foxconn factory in Longhua, [[Shenzhen]] formed a union affiliated with the [[All-China Federation of Trade Unions]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ihloorg030107&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihlo.org/LRC/ACFTU/030107.html |title=ACFTU Union established at Foxconn on the very last day of 2006 |author=[[ITUC]] Hong Kong Liaison Office |date=January 2, 2007 |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese government-approved union umbrella organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt20070405&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/business/worldbusiness/05iht-labor.1.5156948.html McDonald's and KFC seeking to resolve Chinese minimum wage issue ...], April 5, 2007, nytimes.com.

In 2010, a number of workers committed [[suicide]] at a Foxconn operations in China. Apple, HP, and others stated that they were investigating the situation. Foxconn guards have been videotaped beating employees. Another employee killed himself in 2009 when an Apple prototype went missing, and claimed in messages to friends, that he had been beaten and interrogated.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsjDeaTsa20100527&quot;&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704026204575267603576594936.html Suicides Spark Inquiries Apple, H-P to Examine Asian Supplier After String of Deaths at Factory], Jason Dean, Ting-i Tsai, May 27, 2010, accessed May 27, 2010

As of 2006, the iPod was produced by about 14,000 workers in the U.S. and 27,000 overseas. Further, the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled U.S. professionals, as opposed to lower skilled U.S. retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor. One interpretation of this result is that U.S. innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/07/01/winners-and-losers-in-the-apple-economy/ |title=Reuters-Freeland-Winners and Losers in the Apple Economy-July 2011 |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date= July 1, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
